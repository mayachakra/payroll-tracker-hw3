# 03 JavaScript: Employee Payroll Tracker

## User Story
```
AS A payroll manager
I WANT AN employee payroll tracker
SO THAT I can see my employees' payroll data and properly budget for the company
```
## Acceptance Criteria
This website follows the acceptance criteria of:
```
GIVEN an employee payroll tracker
WHEN I click the "Add employee" button
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts asking for first name, last name, and salary
WHEN I finish adding an employee
THEN I am prompted to continue or cancel
WHEN I choose to continue
THEN I am prompted to add a new employee
WHEN I choose to cancel
THEN my employee data is displayed on the page sorted alphabetically by last name, and the console shows computed and aggregated data
```

## Description
For this assignment I altered and added to starter code in order to have a functioning site for a payroll manager. This allows a user to add employees with their first and last name as well as 
a salary. In the console it will also display the salary average and a random employee.
